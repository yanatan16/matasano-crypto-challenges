; I have met them at close of day
; Coming with vivid faces
; From counter or desk among grey
; Eighteenth-century houses.
; I have passed with a nod of the head
; Or polite meaningless words,
; Or have lingered awhile and said
; Polite meaningless words,
; And thought before I had done
; Of a mocking tale or a gibe
; To please a companion
; Around the fire at the club,
; Being certain that they and I
; But lived where motley is worn:
; All changed, changed utterly:
; A terrible beauty is born.

; That woman's days were spent
; In ignorant good-will,
; Her nights in argument
; Until her voice grew shrill.
; What voice more sweet than hers
; When, young and beautiful,
; She rode to harriers?
; This man had kept a school
; And rode our wing√®d horse;
; This other his helper and friend
; Was coming into his force;
; He might have won fame in the end,
; So sensitive his nature seemed,
; So daring and sweet his thought.
; This other man I had dreamed
; A drunken, vainglorious lout.
; He had done most bitter wrong
; To some who are near my heart,
; Yet I number him in the song;
; He, too, has resigned his part
; In the casual comedy;
; He, too, has been changed in his turn,
; Transformed utterly:
; A terrible beauty is born.
